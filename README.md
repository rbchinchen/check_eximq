This is a check for check_mk meant to check the exim mail queue length on cPanel servers. 

Currently the aim would be to put the check file in /opt/omd/sites/<instance>/local/share/check_mk/checks/ and the agent file in /opt/omd/sites/<instance>/local/share/check_mk/agents/

I will add more documentation as needed, but for now I will just get it working.
